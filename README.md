# Katalon-Recorder-sample-projects

## Updates on the four projects

* [Verify textual patterns](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-recorder/docs/how-to-extract-and-verify-textual-patterns-in-a-test-case.html): Outlined the whole workflow with images enlarged and step commands specifically written in text.
* [Extract and write data](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-recorder/docs/write-and-extract-data.html): Removed the loop implementation, limited the use case to extracting just one product info.
* [DDT](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-recorder/docs/implement-data-driven-testing-in-a-test-case.html): Simplified the test case to using only one type of data (booking comment).
* [Control flow](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-recorder/docs/how-to-use-conditional-statements-in-a-test-case.html): Limited the manual steps. I kept the full use of control flow commands (while, if, endIf, endWhile) to demonstrate the capacity of control flow in KR.
