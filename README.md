# Katalon-Recorder-sample-projects

## Updates on the four projects

* Verify textual patterns: Outlined the whole workflow with images enlarged and step commands specifically written in text.
* Extract and write data: Removed the loop implementation, limited the use case to extracting just one product info.
* DDT: Simplified the test case to using only one type of data (booking comment).
* Control flow: Limited the manual steps. I kept the full use of control flow commands (while, if, endIf, endWhile) to demonstrate the capacity of control flow in KR.
